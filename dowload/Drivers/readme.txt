Furthermore, some versions of Windows do not contain the THREED32.OCX component. If Ramsete complains that this file is missing, get it from here, and copy it in c:\Windows\System32
Similarly, on some other systems it is necessary to copy the file named SKEYDRV.DLL in the C.\Windows\System32 directory
These problems will be fixed in the forthcoming version 1.9/2.2 of the Ramsete package
