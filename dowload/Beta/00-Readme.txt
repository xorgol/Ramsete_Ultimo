*** Beta version of forthcoming Ramsete modules ***

In this directory you find the latest available version
of the Ramsete modules under development, which will be included
in the next release of the package.
It is always recommended to upgrade these modules as soon as possible.
Download the files, unzipping if required, and copy them over
the files with the same name (but older date) already present in the
installation directory (usually C:\Ramsete).
Please report any bugs on the Ramsete forum (http://ramsete.forumfree.net)
