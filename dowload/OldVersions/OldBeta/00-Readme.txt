*** Beta version of new Ramsete modules ***
From this directory You can download the latest beta version of some 
of the Ramsete modules.
For testing these Beta modules, You need to take the following steps:
1) Download the ZIP file containing the Beta module
2) Open the ZIP file and look for instructions (if any)
3) Backup the already-existing files with the same names as those
   contained in the ZIP files, moving them away from the directory
   where you did install Ramsete
4) Copy the new beta files in the Ramsete directory
5) Report to the author (farina@pcfarina.eng.unipr.it) any problem.

Enjoy these new versions! The new features are:
- Tons of bugs fixed !

  pressure impulse responses.
- Ramsete View now works with releases 7 and 8 of Golden Software's Surfer
  (support for the old version 6 has been dropped).
- Improved recognition of the dongle on modern platforms (Windows XP, Windows 2003)
